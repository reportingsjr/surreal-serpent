This light ring is intended to go on the intake of a fume extractor I am designing.

The assembly can be done by JLC excluding the Molex Picoblade connector on the back.

The input is a 12V PWM signal. At 100% duty cycle the current draw is approximately 450mA, divided evenly(ish) across ten strings of LEDs.

This project is only half organized, because I spent more time than I wanted on the design and assembly steps and don't feel like spending more energy organizing a hobby project. :)
